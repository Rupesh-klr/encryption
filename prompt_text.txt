This is a sophisticated "Offline-First" Secure Vault application. You are effectively building a mini-VS Code with Git capabilities inside the browser, secured by encryption.

Here is the complete Architecture, Installation Commands, and Code to build this.

📦 Phase 1: Installation & Setup
Run these commands in your terminal to install the necessary "Glassmorphism" UI libraries, State Management (Redux), and Utilities.

Bash
# 1. State Management & Utils
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux axios crypto-js uuid date-fns react-helmet-async

# 2. UI & Animations (Glass effect, Typing, Icons)
npm install framer-motion react-icons clsx tailwind-merge

# 3. Setup Tailwind (If not already installed)
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
📂 Phase 2: Folder Structure
Create this structure to keep your "Hooks", "Redux", and "Components" organized.

🧠 Phase 3: Redux Store (The Brain)
This handles the "500 Limit," "Version History," and "Syncing."
